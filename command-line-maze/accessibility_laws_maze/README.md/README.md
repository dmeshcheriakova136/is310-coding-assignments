# Legislation & Accessibility Maze
**Created by:** Daria Meshcheriakova

## The Goal
Welcome to the path of inclusion & accessbility! Your goal is to navigate through the history of disability legislation—from the early civil rights laws of the 1970s to modern-day school administration—to find the file named **"SUCCESS.txt"**.

## How to Solve
1. **Start:** Look in the current folder for the first era of legislation.
2. **Read Clues:** Use the `cat` command to read the text files you find (e.g., `cat filename.txt`). They will tell you exactly which folder to go to next PS: very easy!.
3. **Navigate:** Use `cd` to move into folders and `ls` to look around.
4. **Watch Out:** Some barriers are invisible! If you get stuck or want to find secret context, try using `ls -a` to see hidden files.

## Windows Users
If you are solving this on Windows (PowerShell), please run the included script first to ensure hidden files work correctly:
`.\hide-dotfiles.ps1`

Good luck!
