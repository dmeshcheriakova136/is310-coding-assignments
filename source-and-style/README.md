Digital Library: https://gutenberg.org/

1. Gutenberg Digital Libraty was built with HTML, css, and have js page budndle. All of it I found in 'Inspect' for this website. When you click 'Read Me' on the books, you can wsee that the page gets open with .html in the end. When you access the folder, you can see the endings of the files in repo as .css .html and .js - they were main indicators for me.

Only one github repo that I was able to find is a plugin that helps to convert books downloaded from Gutenberg in many other formats.

Github: https://github.com/gutenbergtools/ebookmaker


2. I assume that several people worked on thiswebsite overtime. There are several ways you can check it: they should be either menthioned somewhere in contributions on the webpage.  I fnot, you can find a folder with their information in repo, or once you look closely in the code, you can distinguish different coding styles.
